In 2011 <a href="https://www.behance.net/andrij">Andrij Shevchenko</a>'s typeface became a winner of Ukrainian Type Design Competition '<a href="http://ukrainian-type.com/home/">Mystetsky Arsenal</a>' in which three main criteria were sought for: being contemporary, bussinesslike, and Ukrainian. Andrij's entry was crowned Arsenal, and made publicly available.
 
Arsenal font is a semi-grotesque with traditional lettershapes. It is primarily designed for body text and intended for various business communication.
 
The special qualities of lettershapes and subtle contrast modulation serve as means of articulating grace and expressivity. A somewhat lyrical feeling abides to the Ukrainian nature of the font. 

Main design features: narrow proportions for economical type-setting, moderate aperture and observable contrast. Notable traits: neutrality, clarity, swiftness.
